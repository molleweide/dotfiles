# TODO: It feels like the core also should be moved into a dorothy command so
# that you can use reuse this easilly.

# =======================================================
# Load fzf support bindings
#
# NOTE: I dont believe anything here calls anything above
# directly, so this could be kept alone in the source
# loaders script, and all of the above could be moved to its
# own lib/files, and further refactored for dorothy purposes.

# NOTE: I believe that we should have an improved system for making keybinds
# with dorothy so that it is a bit more automated. Maybe, this could go
# into somekind of keybinds.sh file.
# BUT i am not sure  all of this should be managed. so now i think that a good
# way is just to explore how such bindings work and stuff so that we can
# have some nice extra control bindings in the shell.

# bind [-m keymap] [-lpsvPSVX]
# bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq]
# bind [-m keymap] -f filename
# bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq:shell-command
# bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name
# bind [-m keymap] keyseq:readline-command
# bind readline-command-line
#        Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline
#        function or macro, or set a readline variable.  Each non-option argument is a command as
#        it would appear in a readline initialization file such as .inputrc, but each binding or
#        command must be passed as a separate argument; e.g., '"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file'.
#        Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
#        -m keymap
#               Use keymap as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.  Acceptable
#               keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move,
#               vi-command, and vi-insert.  vi is equivalent to vi-command (vi-move is also a
#               synonym); emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.
#        -l     List the names of all readline functions.
#        -p     Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-
#               read.
#        -P     List current readline function names and bindings.
#        -s     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such
#               a way that they can be re-read.
#        -S     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.
#        -v     Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.
#        -V     List current readline variable names and values.
#        -f filename
#               Read key bindings from filename.
#        -q function
#               Query about which keys invoke the named function.
#        -u function
#               Unbind all keys bound to the named function.
#        -r keyseq
#               Remove any current binding for keyseq.
#        -x keyseq:shell-command
#               Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.  When shell-command
#               is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the contents of the
#               readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT and READLINE_MARK variables to the
#               current location of the insertion point and the saved insertion point (the mark),
#               respectively.  The shell assigns any numeric argument the user supplied to the
#               READLINE_ARGUMENT variable.  If there was no argument, that variable is not set.
#               If the executed command changes the value of any of READLINE_LINE, READLINE_POINT,
#               or READLINE_MARK, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.
#        -X     List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the associated commands in a
#               format that can be reused as input.
#
#        The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.

# reset-prompt (unbound) (unbound) (unbound)
#        Force the prompts on both the left and right of the screen to be
#        re-expanded, then redisplay the edit buffer.  This reflects
#        changes both to the prompt variables themselves and changes in
#        the expansion of the values (for example, changes in time or
#        directory, or changes to the value of variables referred to by
#        the prompt).
#
#        Otherwise, the prompt is only expanded each time zle starts, and
#        when the display has been interrupted by output from another
#        part of the shell (such as a job notification) which causes the
#        command line to be reprinted.
#
#        reset-prompt doesn't alter the special parameter LASTWIDGET.
#
#
# USER-DEFINED WIDGETS
#        User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can
#        execute any normal shell command.  They can also run other
#        widgets (whether built-in or user-defined) using the zle builtin
#        command. The standard input of the function is redirected from
#        /dev/null to prevent external commands from unintentionally
#        blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but read -k or read
#        -q can be used to read characters.  Finally, they can examine
#        and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by reading and setting the
#        special parameters described below.
#
#        These special parameters are always available in widget
#        functions, but are not in any way special outside ZLE.  If they
#        have some normal value outside ZLE, that value is temporarily
#        inaccessible, but will return when the widget function exits.
#        These special parameters in fact have local scope, like
#        parameters created in a function using local.
#
#        Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active,
#        these parameters are available read-only.
#
#        Note that the parameters appear as local to any ZLE widget in
#        which they appear.  Hence if it is desired to override them this
#        needs to be done within a nested function:
#
#               widget-function() {
#                 # $WIDGET here refers to the special variable
#                 # that is local inside widget-function
#                 () {
#                    # This anonymous nested function allows WIDGET
#                    # to be used as a local variable.  The -h
#                    # removes the special status of the variable.
#                    local -h WIDGET
#                 }
#               }
#
#
#      LBUFFER (scalar)
#              The part of the buffer that lies to the left of the cursor position.  If it is assigned to, only that part of the
#              buffer is replaced, and the cursor remains between the new $LBUFFER and the old $RBUFFER.
